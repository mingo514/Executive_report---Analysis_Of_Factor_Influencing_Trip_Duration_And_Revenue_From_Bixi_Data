# Analysis of Factors Influencing Trip Duration and Revenue from BIXI Data

This repository contains the code and reports for the statistical analysis of BIXI Montreal's bike-sharing system data. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors that influence trip duration, revenue, and overall usage based on the 2021 season's data.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into four parts, each aimed at exploring different statistical models and providing insights into BIXI's trip and revenue data.

## Data

The dataset includes details on BIXI rentals such as start/end time, stations, trip duration, user type (member or non-member), and weather conditions.

## Repository Contents

- **Part1-Exploratory analysis**: Initial data exploration to understand the variables and their relationships.
- **Part2-Linear regression models**: Analysis using linear regression to investigate trip duration and revenue.
- **Part3-Generalized linear models**: Use of generalized linear models to study the number of rentals and the average trip duration.
- **Part4-Linear mixed models**: Advanced modeling to account for potential correlations within stations.
